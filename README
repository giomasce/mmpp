This is experimental code, it does not do anything sensible at the moment.
It implements a parser and verifier for Metamath files (see
http://us.metamath.org/index.html), together with some tools to do some
operations with their content. For example, it can prove type assertions
(e.g, assertion beginning with "wff", "class" or "set" in set.mm) and it
can prove propositional calculus assertions (provided they are true).

== COMPILATION ==

Clone the repository and use qmake and make (you need to install them if
you do not already have them):

git clone https://github.com/giomasce/mmpp.git
cd mmpp
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ..
make

mmpp is currently developed on Debian and only tested on that. The code
uses some pretty recent features of C++ (C++14 and maybe even C++17), so
a fairly recent compiler is required. The code was written trying to
depend as few as possible of any platform, but as I said no testing
has been done so far. It depends on boost (which should be portable)
and on libdl (which is probably Linux-specific, but the library is
not really essential). In short, probably the program does not compile
on Windows on Mac OS X at the moment, but it should not be difficult
to make it do so.

== RUN ==

As I said, the code is proof-of-concept and does not do much. If you run
it it will perform a lot of self tests and then exit.

You will need the metamath-test suite in order to run the tests. The tests
will be searched in "../metamath-test" (this is currently hardcoded in the
variable test_basename in main.cpp). Continuing from the commands above:

cd ..
git clone https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/metamath-test.git
cd build
./mmpp

Enjoy! :-)
